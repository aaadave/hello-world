# hello-world
I am just starting.
I have no idea what "Project" I will be working on. I just started this adventure and my end goal is to learn Blockchain Development. I know that in order to do that I first have to learn coding. So here goes. I am working full time. Since I initially started this with Truecoders I have been traveling a whole lot and was working about 18 hours a day plus writing reports, so I have not had time to do anything with Truecoders. That is why I am just getting started today.
